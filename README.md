# XMLParsing
This is small study project. I just tried to use DOM and SAX xml parsers to parse xml file. After that I saved results into Oracle DB, using JDBC and Hibernate. For testing parsers classes I used junit5.

Stack:
- java 8 (streams, lambda expressions);
- junit 5;
- javax.xml.parsers (DOM and SAX);
- JDBC;
- Hibernate.
